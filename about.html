                    <h4>Our Mission</h4>
                    <p>The "solo" pupose of the heat trader is to provide the world with a platform that allows access to fashion from all walks of life essentially without having to come out of pocket.
                        We know how ridiculous prices can be for certain shoes and clothes. Therefore here at The Heat Trader, we belive strongly in a Barter Economy which simpky means exchanging (trading) goods of
                        equal value depending on the parties involved. The Heat Trader strongly promotes positive mental health; with that being said we personally dont feel like individual should go broke over sneaker.

                    <h4>"The History"</h4>
                    <p>The Heat Trader was founded February 23, 2021 in Atlanta, GA where we are currently based out of. Growing up El Presidente would alwasy pressure his mother to buy the newest sneaker. 
                        The day came that he was no longer wearing kids shoes and movedup to mens, thus making sneakers cost alot more. As a child Carl would cut grass every weekend to save enough to afford 
                        shoes that came out towards the end of the month. As his collection of sneakers grew he would trade sneakers that he was able to get when they released with his friends at school who did have what he was looking for.
                        Years later El Pres realized how many people genuinly dont want to pay $200+ everytime a shoe came out and would much rather trade sneakers of equal value, thus birthing.. THE HEAT TRADER!
